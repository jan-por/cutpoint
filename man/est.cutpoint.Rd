\usage{
est.cutpoint(
  cpvarname,
  time = "time",
  event = "event",
  covariates = NULL,
  data = data,
  nbofcp = 1,
  bandwith = 0.1,

}
\arguments{
\item{cpvarname}{character, name of the variable for which the cutpoints are
estimated}

\item{time}{character, this is the follow-up time}

\item{event}{character, the status indicator, normally 0=no event, 1=event}

\item{covariates}{character vector with the names of the covariates or/ and
factors. If there are no covariates set: covariates = NULL}

\item{data}{a data.frame, contains the following variables: variable which is
dichotomized, follow-up time, event (status indicator) and the covariates}

\item{nbofcp}{numeric, number of cutpoints to be estimated}

\item{bandwith}{numeric, minimum group size in percent of the total sample
size, bandwith must be between 0 and 0.3}

\item{ushape}{logical value: if TRUE, the cutpoints are estimated under the
assumtion that the spline plot shows a u-form}

\item{symtails}{logical value: if TRUE, the cutpoints are estimated with
symmetric tails. If nbofcp=1, symtails is set to FALSE}

\item{dp}{numeric, number of decimal places the cutpoints are rounded to}

\item{plot_splines}{logical value: if TRUE, a penalized spline plot is
created}

\item{all_splines}{logical value: if TRUE, the plot shows splines with
different degrees of freedom. This may help identify if overfitting occurs.}

\value{
returns the estimated cutpoints and the characteristics of the
groups in relation to the original data set

\description{
One or two cutpoints of a variable are estimated by the AIC
criterion in a Cox proportional hazards model. The cutpoints are estimated
by dichotomizing the variable. The cutpoints with the lowest AIC value are
chosen.
