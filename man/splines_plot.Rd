\title{Plot penalized smoothing splines and shows cutpoints}
\usage{
splines_plot(cpobj, show_splines = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cpobj}{list, contains variables for pspline plot: nb_of_cp (number of
cutpoints), cp (contain one or two cutpoint/s), dp (digits for plot),
cpvarname (name of the variable for which the cutpoints are estimated)
cpdata (a data.frame, contains the following variables: variable which is
dichotomized, time (follow-up time), event (status indicator) and covariates
(a vector with the names of the covariates))}

\item{show_splines}{logical value: if TRUE, shows the splines for different
degree of freedom. This may help identify if overfitting occurs.}
}
\value{
returns a plot with penalized smoothing splines and shows the
cutpoints
}
\description{
Create penalized smoothing splines plot with different degrees
of freedom and shows the cutpoints of the biomarker
}
\examples{
biomarker <- rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 10)
time <- seq(1, 100, 1)
event <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)
datf <- data.frame(time, event, biomarker)
plot_splines_list <- list(cpdata = datf, nb_of_cp = 1, cp = 95, dp = 2,
    cpvarname = "Biomarker")
splines_plot(plot_splines_list)
