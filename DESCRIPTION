Description: One or two cutpoints of a metric variable are estimated using
    the AIC criterion within a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.
    These cutpoints are used to create two or three groups with different
    survival probabilities. The cutpoints are estimated by dichotomizing the
    variable of interest, which is then incorporated into the Cox-regression
    model. The biomarker cutpoint is the value at which the AIC reaches its
    lowest value for the corresponding Cox-regression model. This process
    occurs within a multivariable framework, as other covariates and/or
    factors are considered during the search for the cutpoints.
    Cutpoints can also be estimated when the variable of interest shows 
    a U-shaped or inverse U-shaped relationship with to hazard ratio of 
    time-to-event data. The argument symtail allows for the estimation of two 
    cutpoints, ensuring that the two outer tails represent groups of equal size.
