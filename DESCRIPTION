Description: Estimate one or two cutpoints of a metric or ordinal-scaled 
    variable in the multivariable context of survival data or 
    time-to-event data. Visualise the cutpoint estimation process using contour 
    plots, index plots, and spline plots. It is also possible to estimate 
    cutpoints based on the assumption of a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped 
    relationship between the predictor and the hazard ratio.
