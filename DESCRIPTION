Description: One or two cutpoints of a metric variable are estimated using 
    either the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or the LRT 
    (Likelihood-Ratio Test statistic) within a multivariable Cox proportional 
    hazards model.
    These cutpoints are used to create two or three groups with different
    survival probabilities. The cutpoints are estimated by dichotomising the
    variable of interest, which is then incorporated into the Cox-regression
    model. The biomarker cutpoint is the value at which the AIC reaches its
    lowest value or the LRT statistics his minimum for the corresponding 
    Cox-regression model. This process occurs within a multivariable framework, 
    as other covariates and/or factors are considered during the search for the 
    cutpoints. Cutpoints can also be estimated when the variable of interest 
    shows a U-shaped or inverse U-shaped relationship to the hazard ratio of 
    time-to-event data. The argument symtail facilitates the estimate of two 
    cutpoints, ensuring that the two outer tails represent groups of equal size.
